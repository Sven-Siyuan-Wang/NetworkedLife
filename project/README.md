Linear regression method: [linearRegression.py](NeworkedLife/project/linearRegression.py)

Linear regression with neighborhood method: [neighborhood.py](NeworkedLife/project/neighborhood.py)

RBM with extensions integrated: [mainRBM.py](NeworkedLife/project/mainRBM.py) ([mainRBM-epoch.py](NeworkedLife/project/mainRBM-epoch.py) is less performant in general, adaptive learning rate formula is alpha/epoch)

Note: all implementations of extensions are commented with "EXTENSION: ***" for your convenience
