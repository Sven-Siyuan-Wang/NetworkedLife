Linear regression method: [linearRegression.py](NeworkedLife/project/linearRegression.py)
Linear regression with neighborhood method: neighborhood.py
RBM with extensions integrated: mainRBM.py (mainRBM-epoch.py is less performant in general, adaptive learning rate formula is alpha/epoch)

Note: all implementations of extensions are commented with "EXTENSION: ****" for your convenience
